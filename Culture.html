<p>Traditional Nepali society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy. The Nepali caste system embodies much of the social stratification and many of the social restrictions found in South Asia. Social classes are defined by more than a hundred endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis, or "castes". Nepal declared untouchability to be illegal in 1963[288] and has since enacted other anti-discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives. At the workplace and educational institutions in urban Nepal, caste-related identification has pretty much lost its importance.<br><br>
Family values are important in the Nepali tradition, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm in Nepal, though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas. An overwhelming majority of Nepalis, with or without their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders. Marriage is thought to be for life, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18.<br><br>
Many Nepali festivals are religious in origin. The best known include: Dashain, Tihar, Teej, Chhath, Maghi, Sakela, Holi, Eid ul-Fitr, Christmas, and the Nepali new year.<br><br>
The rich cultural heritage of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal has evolved over centuries. This multidimensional cultural heritage encompass within itself cultural diversities of various ethnic, tribal, and social groups which is manifested in various forms such as music and dance, art and craft, folklore and folktales, languages and literature, philosophy and religion, festivals and celebrations, and foods and drinks.<br><br>
Nepal, a landlocked country of South Asia, shares its borders with China and India. The population of Nepal mainly consist of Tibeto-Burmans from the north and Indo-Aryans from the south. This ethnic diversity and proximity to neighbouring giant cultures have also influenced its culture. Nepal, thus, has inherited several customs and cultural practices from the north (China and Tibet) as well as from the south (India), and over a period of time attuned the same to its own indigenous requirements based on its topography, resources and climate.<br><br>
Nepal’s culture is greatly influenced by music, architecture, religion and literature. This is more evident from various architecturally rich temples, churches, monasteries and other religious buildings that are found in every corner of the country.
